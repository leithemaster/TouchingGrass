# Touching Grass 

Touching Grass is a minimalist website developed using Spline and React. Inspired by a YouTuber I've recently started watching, who also created a Touching Grass website, I wanted to craft something similar in my own unique style, without intending to outdo her work. The site's design emphasizes the concept of "touching grass," and I hope it effectively captures that essence.

## Lessons Learned

Developing "Touching Grass" was a profound journey into the nuances of minimalist design and its impact on user experience. One of the most significant lessons I learned was the power of simplicity in conveying a strong message. By stripping away unnecessary elements and focusing solely on the essence of "touching grass," I was able to create a more immersive and meaningful experience for users.

Working with Spline integrated into a React application taught me how to seamlessly blend 3D design elements into a web interface without compromising performance or usability. It challenged me to think critically about spatial design and how users interact with three-dimensional spaces on the web.

Moreover, drawing inspiration while striving to maintain originality highlighted the delicate balance between influence and innovation in design. This project reinforced the importance of crafting unique experiences that reflect personal creativity, even when inspired by existing works.
